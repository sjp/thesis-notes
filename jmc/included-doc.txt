Packages:

- gridSVG: Latest version available on R-Forge
  install.packages("gridSVG", repos="http://R-Forge.R-project.org")
- selectr: Latest version available on CRAN
  install.packages("selectr")
- animaker: Latest version available on GitHub
  https://github.com/pmur002/animaker
  Windows binary:

Additionally it must be noted because the XML package is required for
gridSVG, it is recommended that it is installed in the following
manner.

R CMD INSTALL --configure-args='--enable-nodegc=no' XML_3.9-4.tar.gz

This this because the XML package can often cause segfaults otherwise
(due to both R and libxml2 attempting to free the same piece of
memory).

Documentation:

Documentation is included within each of the R packages for each
function.

A draft journal article has been submitted to the Journal of
Statistical Software. The draft is available at:

Technical reports have also been published which show
example usage of each package.

- For animaker, the following technical reports are available:

  -  Generating Animation Sequence Descriptions - Paul Murrell, Simon Potter

Examples:

The previously mentioned technical reports contain some example usage
of the software but no interactive examples where R is present. It is
recommended for best results that Google Chrome is used to view these
examples. Mozilla Firefox will work but its performance is not as good
with my testing. Any up-to-date browser should be capable of viewing
these examples.
