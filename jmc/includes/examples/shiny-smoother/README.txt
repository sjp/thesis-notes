This example aims to show how the tools that we have developed can be used in
conjunction with RStudio's 'shiny' package.

For comparison purposes, a 'static' version of this example has been created
as well as a 'gridSVG' example. The advantage we see with the gridSVG example
is the transitioning between smoothing parameter states.

From within this directory, source one of the following files to run the
example:

- 'run-gridsvg.R'
- 'run-static.R'
