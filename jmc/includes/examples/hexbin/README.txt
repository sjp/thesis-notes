This example attempts to compare two different types of encoding hexagonal
binning.

Because this is a slow process it can take around 10s to prepare the random
data and run the hexagonal binning routines prior to launching the webserver.

To run this example, from within this directory, use R to source in
'run-hexbin.R'.
