This example aims to provide a simple interface for building simple ARMA
models, and observing the resulting diagnostic plots (ACF and PACF plots).

By default this uses the 'Nile' dataset that is built into R but other
datasets have been also been provided in the 'datasets/' directory.

To run this example, from within this directory, using R source in the file
'run-arma.R'.
