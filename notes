IDEA:

  + modify 'gridSVG' to auto-insert a javascript function, say convert(), 
    into SVG output (plus an array of constants) that effectively 
    records the coordinate system conversions for every 'grid'
    viewport.  Then you can easily write javascript code to 
    do things like add a new shape at a location within a viewport
    (SVG <g>) that are positioned relative to the "native" coordinate
    system of the original 'grid' viewport (e.g., draw stuff relative
    to plot axis scales)

THE BIG EXAMPLE:

  + A web page containing a scatterplot (SVG) and a slider.

    The slider controls the "smoothness" of a smoother 
    through the data on the scatterplot.

    The smoother (line in the scatterplot) is updated
    by the web browser talking to R and getting new 
    information to describe the smoother and then
    the SVG scatterplot is modified in place.

    NOT generating an entire new scatterplot from R.

    NOT producing an initial plot with all possible 
    smoothers and then showing/hiding the appropriate ones.


TODO:

  + Add note about RStatServer (RSOAP, RSessionDA, R-Zope?)

    All Greg Warnes stuff that appears abandoned?

    http://research.warnes.net/statcomp/projects/RStatServer/   

  + Set up git repos for working with Paul

  + Investigate some more R-web tech (Rook and R-Node and websockets)

  + Keep thinking about categorisation of different options
    (including diagram and glossary)

  + Document the example code (and ALL example code from now on!)

  + Explore javascript libraries for manipulating SVG/DOM?


PAUL TODO:

  + READ Simon's notes

  + Email Jay Emerson


DONE:

  + Overview of ways to set up R as web back-end

    See 2012-07-25/notes-2012-07-17.txt (Org-mode doc)

PAUL DONE:

  + Check timings and deadlines with Arden for Master Thesis

    Simon is officially part-time, so has until Sem 2 2013 to finish!

  + Overview of ways to set up R as web back-end

    RFirefox
    SNetscape
    Rserve
    RSOAP
    R.NET.Web
    Rpad
    RApache
    Rcgi

    - find them all 
        - Google
        - R-forge
        - R-help
        - http://www.sciviews.org/_rgui/
        - GSoC

    - document them all
        - short description
        - feature list
        - categorisation (client/server, ...)
        - state (active, dead, developing)
        - who is involved
        - pros and cons

    - implement a simple example
        - a single SVG circle that on-click is modified BY R
          (e.g., R selects a new random location for the circle)


IDEAS:

  + Another reason to "flatten" the grid display list
    (flattening would take gTrees and replace them with
     their children [being careful to store all relevant 
     info for correctly drawing the children in the children])

    Could then have a combination of viewports and grobs where
    you could draw more "efficiently" by creating each viewport
    and then drawing ALL grobs in that viewport
    (no need to get going back into and out of the same viewport)
    => things like clipping become easier
    (have a clean tree structure)

+ Masters degree Guidelines

+ Main idea is system for creating dynamic interactive plots

+ Probably based on gridSVG, but with R as live back-end to update
  SVG on-the-fly

+ Competing projects are the usual suspects 
  (protovis, Google Viz API, ...)

  PLUS Duncan Temple-Lang's
  - SVGAnnotation
  - R embedded in Firefox

  PLUS Simon Urbanek's projects
  - FastRWeb (and R graphics)
  - WebGL and WS+Rserve

+ Also see some of the discussion on GSOC 2012 about interactive web 
  graphics.

  Matt Shotwell has some good ideas about a "grammar" or "language"
  for expressing interactive graphics

+ Awwation for animated zooming presentation slides

  Useful comments on SVG vs Canvas 

  Nice example demo linked at the bottom.

+ Sasha Goodman wants to combine 'gridSVG' and D3 

  http://vis.stanford.edu/papers/d3

  See email discussion in 'gridSVG' folder (2012-04)


Simon's BIG IDEA:

  + Keep R in the picture.

    Rather than ...

    R -> SVG -> Browser

    ... do something like ...

    R <-> (SVG <->) browser

  + Applications:

    - VIT done better (Chris Wild's stuff)

    - Plot "templates" that you can choose the data for

    - Dynamic reporting

  
INFO:

  + Masters (following BSc honours)
 
  + 6 paper project (instead of 2)

    => 90 points

    => "Thesis"

  + 2 papers already done


PAUL TODO:

  + Check timings and deadlines with Arden for Master Thesis
