\chapter{Conclusion}

The \gridSVG{} package for \R{} has been extended to create animated and interactive graphics for the web.
It is now capable of producing plots from the \textsf{lattice} and \textsf{ggplot2} packages with the ability to animate and interact with them.

We have described the methods and decisions made during the development of \gridSVG{}.
Primarily, the process of mapping \grid{} graphics objects and viewports to SVG code was discussed.

Applications of \gridSVG{} have demonstrated features that the \R{} graphics engine cannot produce.
These features provide a more engaging method of presenting quantitative and qualitative information than static graphics.
