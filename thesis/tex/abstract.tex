We describe an approach taken for the creation of animated and interactive graphics using the \grid{} graphics engine for the statistical software package \R{}.
In order to create these graphics an existing package for \R{}, \gridSVG{}, is extended from a proof-of-concept into a usable solution.
\gridSVG{} produces SVG images that are animated, interactive and can be included within web pages.
